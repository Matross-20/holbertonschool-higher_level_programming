# Python - Abstract Classes and Interfaces

* Abstract Classes: Understand and apply abstract classes to define common interfaces while enforcing certain levels of class completeness.
* Interfaces and Duck Typing: Grasp the concept of interfaces and duck typing to ensure that objects adhere to a specific contract or protocol.
* Subclassing Standard Base Classes: Learn to extend standard base classes like lists, dictionaries, and iterators to create custom data structures with specialized behavior.
* Method Overriding: Employ method overriding to alter or enhance the behavior of base class methods.
* Multiple Inheritance: Understand and apply multiple inheritance to form complex relationships between classes.
* Mixins: Utilize mixins to compose behavior across unrelated classes.
